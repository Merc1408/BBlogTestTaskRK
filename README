Manual test cases BBLOG_CASES_CRUD.xlsx
Automated tests in folder BBlogTestTaskRK(Java + Selenium Webdriver + TestNG)

For running tests, please:
1. Open Terminal
2. Go to folder BBlogTestTaskRK(use cd command for that)
3. Run command - "mvn clean test"
Options for running tests:
- mvn clean test -Dbrowser.name = browserName(chrome or firefox) -Dheadless.mode = headlessMode(true or false). Chrome and false uses by default. Headless mode
allow to run tests without opening browser(for that you need set true option)
4. For getting report run "mvn allure:serve"

For adding new tests we can use DataProvider class and create different test data for test and mix it with tests to increase cover rate.

PS: TestNG.xml for choosing tests for execution.
PSS: I chose typical CRUD tests for automation others can be added as already existing.
